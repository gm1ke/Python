# Conclusion
In this task, we found that the results for trial stores 77 and 86 showed a statistically significant difference in at least two stores of the three months of the trial period. However, this was not the case for store 88. We can check to see if the trial was implemented differently in store 88 but even so, we have been able to see that the trial has resulted in a significant increase in sales.
